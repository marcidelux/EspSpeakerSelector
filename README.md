# ESP SPEAKER SELECTOR

## Short description
This is a small project made for my friend. The main idea is the following:
There is one speaker output from an amplifier goes in to this device.
There are four buttons on the device to be able to select which pair of speakers should the amp drive. It works with relays.
Alongside with the buttons It can be controlled via Webpage hosted by the ESP8266. There is a Setting page mode for set the SSID, password, Static Ip address and gateway. It uses EEPROM to save the last selected speaker to remember for the next time the device is turned on.
